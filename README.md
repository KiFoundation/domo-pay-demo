# Application Demo

Domo provides a framework allowing you to optimize order and payment tunnel on your applications.

Indeed, you will be able to :

* [automatically access delivery information](https://docs.foundation.ki/domo/domo-pay-connect/access-delivery-information) \(address, zipcode, city...\) ;
* [collect payment via an optimized workflow](https://docs.foundation.ki/domo/domo-pay-connect/collect-a-payment) \(credit card or room charge\).
* [automatically access guest information](https://docs.foundation.ki/domo/domo-pay-connect/access-guest-information) \(name, first name, phone, email\) after payment.

This repository is a simple but complete demonstration of these features

For more information, please read [our documentation](https://docs.foundation.ki/domo/domo-pay-connect).
